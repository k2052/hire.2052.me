# About Me

I'm a full-stack developer from North Idaho. I'm ridiculously good at building modern JS apps using React, Redux, GraphQL, and node.js. I'm a polyglot that writes about code stuff at [GetGood.at](https://getGood.at). I would love to work on tools for developers or designers, or both -- the future of dev is design.
