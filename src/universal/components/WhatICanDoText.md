## What I Can Do

- full-stack modern JavaScript
- React + Redux + GraphQL + node apps
- Ruby apps

If you want to hire me full time I can easily ramp up on anything. I have a particular fondness for functional programming languages like Clojure, Haskell, and Reason. I have dabbled in a bit of everything from C++ to Prolog, checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/k2052) or read my [developer bio](http://developer.2052.me) to learn more.
